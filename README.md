## Overview

A lightweight, fast, and accessible research portfolio for **Luca Celebrano**, MD candidate and computational oncology researcher at the **Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Università degli Studi di Napoli Federico II**.

It showcases current scientific manuscripts, open-source computational oncology systems, spatial transcriptomics and spatial omics tools, interactive Hugging Face spaces, and prior algorithmic engineering projects.

This portfolio is purposefully separated from institutional analysis pipelines and thesis codebases. It serves as a personal index of research and software, not a clinical decision support system.

## Sections

- **Research & Publications** — Peer-reviewed manuscripts (including the submission for *Scientific Reports* and translational preprints on *Research Square*).
- **Research Systems** — Spatial Continuum Oncology, InSituGame, InSituVision-AI, Spatial Oncology Master, and related analytical frameworks.
- **Interactive Lab** — 2D/3D digital twins, biophysical reaction-diffusion simulators, and public benchmark datasets hosted on Hugging Face.
- **Clinical Training** — MedTerminal Cardio-Thoracic emergency medicine interactive trainer.
- **Previous Engineering Work** — Arbitrage Inception and open-source decentralized systems.
- **Side Quests** — Interactive easter eggs, cinematic literary and anime quotes (Tolkien, Naruto, Disney, Harry Potter, Dragon Ball), and ambient soundscape in Luca's Cave.

## Technical Architecture

Built as a high-performance static Progressive Web App (PWA) with a minimal build step:

- Semantic HTML5;
- Custom responsive CSS with design tokens;
- Lightweight vanilla JavaScript bundled with `esbuild`;
- Google Analytics 4 (GA4) and Google Tag Manager (GTM) telemetry with custom click and engagement event streaming;
- Web App Manifest (`manifest.webmanifest`) and offline Service Worker (`sw.js`);
- Comprehensive Open Graph 2.0 and Twitter Card metadata with optimized social preview cards;
- JSON-LD `Person` schema structured data;
- Validated `robots.txt` and XML sitemap;
- High-resolution SVG/PNG app and touch icons;
- Serverless and zero-database architecture.

The interface is engineered for keyboard accessibility, reduced motion preferences (`prefers-reduced-motion`), mobile devices, and high-density desktop displays. Audio is strictly opt-in and never autoplays.

## Local Development

Install dependencies and start the local preview server:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
python3 -m http.server 4173
```

Navigate to <http://localhost:4173>.

## Deployment

The production deployment is hosted statically on GitHub Pages with custom domain and automated Let's Encrypt SSL:

**[lucacelebrano.me](https://lucacelebrano.me/)**

Continuous deployment triggers automatically on push to the `main` branch.

## Project Structure

- [`index.html`](./index.html): Main portfolio interface and structured semantic sections.
- [`styles.css`](./styles.css): Design system, responsive layouts, typography, and dark theme tokens.
- [`app.js`](./app.js): Interactive controls, audio player, telemetry handlers, and terminal logic.
- [`privacy.html`](./privacy.html): GDPR (EU 2016/679) disclosure and medical-scientific disclaimers.
- [`cookie-policy.html`](./cookie-policy.html): ePrivacy and technical storage disclosure.
- [`sitemap.xml`](./sitemap.xml) & [`robots.txt`](./robots.txt): Search engine discovery and indexing maps.
